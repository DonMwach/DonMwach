I’m Don Mwach (Mr. Google).
I am a Software Engineer, Full-Stack Web Developer, System Analyst, and Network Security Enthusiast.

I am deeply interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Blockchain, Cloud Computing, Data Warehousing, Telecommunication, and emerging innovations in computing and automotive technology.

I have experience in front-end and back-end development, digital marketing, networking, and technical research. I also write blogs on Ethereum, StarkNet, and broader blockchain technologies. I enjoy combining creativity and tech through writing, poetry, and community engagement.

I am currently expanding my skills in cloud architecture, cybersecurity, distributed systems, and production-level software engineering with tools like Python, Flask, Java Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and virtualization technologies.

I am open to collaborating on software projects, research work, technical writing, and community-focused tech solutions.
